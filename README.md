# School Spacial Relations

This project aims to work on the fuzzy spacial relations.

# To Do

Those lists are the atomic steps to accomplish in order to produce a graphical application
that allows the user to load two binary images with objects and display the associated F-histogram

## Basic functions

  * ~Implement the `bresenham` function~
  * Implement the `scan_linear` function to execute Bresenham on all parallels
  * Implement the `scan_polar` function to execute Bresenham on all angles

## GUI functions

  * ~Implement the image loading from a button~ (may be twice for two images)
  * Implement the histogram display - classic
  * Implement the histogram display - radial

## Process functions

  * Complete this section
